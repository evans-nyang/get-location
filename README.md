# Location Detection

Simple web application to retrieve a user's location

## üìå Overview

This project provides a web-based solution to detect a user's location with multiple fallback methods for accuracy.

It offers:

- GPS-based location detection (most accurate)

- Network-based location detection

- IP-based location fallback

- Options to view the detected location on Google Maps or OpenStreetMap

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

No installation required! Simply:

5. View your location on the map or copy the coordinates.
6. You can also view the location on Google Maps or OpenStreetMap by clicking the respective buttons.
7. The application will automatically fall back to network-based or IP-based location detection if GPS is unavailable.
8. The application will also display an error message if location detection fails. -->
